## Overview
At the Warrior Rec Center, high demand for basketball and volleyball courts, especially after 5 PM, makes it difficult for students to secure playing time. Our web app solves this problem by allowing students to:
- Reserve court time for their groups.
- Find and join existing groups to secure a spot.
