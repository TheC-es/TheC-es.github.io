## Overview
At the Warrior Rec Center, there is limited space and many people who want to use the courts to play basketball or volleyball.

This gets especially bad after 5 pm, when it can be hard to get a spot on the court with so many people competing.

Our final project is a web app that seeks to solve this problem by allowing students to reserve time on the courts for their groups, and to look for groups to join.

## Mockup Page
Our web app would contain the following pages:

- landing page

# <img width="500px"  src="/img/landingpage.png" >

- login and sign up page

# <img width="500px"  src="/img/Login.png" >
# <img width="500px"  src="/img/Register.png" >

- schedule page showing times already reserved
- page to reserve times for a group
- looking for team page, where players without a group can find one
# <img width="500px"  src="/img/reserve.png" >
